Printing Shapes
Create a program that:
1.  Prompt the user to choose between a rectangle and a triangle
2.  Prompt user for shape parameters
      a)  Rectangle
        Ask user to choose between supplying a word or a width
        Ask user for height
      b)  Triangle
        Ask user to choose between supplying a word or a width, and whether the triangle points up or down
        Read input
3.  Print the desired shape
4.  Ask the user whether they want to print to a file, “myshape.txt”, or to cout
5.  Ask the user if they would like to exit, or return to step 1

Any input requested from the user should only be one character in length per decision.

Points:
2 - Documentation, readability, format
2 - Proper program flow (conditionals, loops, etc)
1 - File output
1 - Functions
2 - Filename and Header
2 - Output testing
